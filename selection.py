    `chosen` is loaded and sent downstream THIS run. `next_filename` is
    pushed back into the widget after execution, becoming the starting
    point for the NEXT run - the advance always happens after the current
    file has already been output, never before.

    Sequential mode keeps an in-memory pointer keyed by (unique_id, directory)
    as the source of truth once seeded from `filename`. Without it, queuing
    several executions back-to-back (e.g. a batch count > 1) would have every
    one of them read the same `filename` snapshotted at queue time and all
    load the same file instead of advancing - the in-memory pointer is only
    visible to executions that have actually run, so each one sees the real
    advance made by the one before it. `directory` is folded into the key
    since ComfyUI's unique_id is just a small per-graph integer, not globally
    unique - two unrelated workflows reusing the same node id would otherwise
    share (and corrupt) each other's sequential pointer.
